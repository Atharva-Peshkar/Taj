Fun facts - 

*) The Taj Mahal was built in 1648 and was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000â€“2007) initiative.

*) The minarets of the Taj Mahal are one of its most distinctive features. They are four slender towers that are evenly spaced around the main dome of the mausoleum. The minarets are also slightly tilted outward, which is an intentional design feature. 

There are several reasons why the minarets of the Taj Mahal are leaning outward.
1) The minarets are not attached to the main structure of the mausoleum. They are set back from the main building and are only attached at the base. This was done intentionally so that if the minarets were to ever collapse, they would fall away from the Taj Mahal and not damage the main structure. 

2) The minarets are slightly tilted so that they appear to be leaning when viewed from the ground. This was done to create an optical illusion and make the minarets appear taller than they actually are. 

3) The minarets are made of lighter materials than the rest of the Taj Mahal. This was done to keep the minarets from being too heavy and putting too much stress on the structure
